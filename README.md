# AlumniNetworkSpringBootApplication


This is a web application that allows Northeastern University students to connect with alumni. The application has the following features:

User profiles: Students can update their profiles with information about their education, work experience, and interests. Alumni can also create profiles to showcase their professional backgrounds.

Referrals: Alumni can post referrals that they are willing to provide to students who meet certain criteria. Students can view these referrals and comment to express their interest and get more visibility.

The application is built using several technologies, including:

Spring Boot: a framework for building web applications in Java

Hibernate: an object-relational mapping library for working with databases

HTML, CSS, and JavaScript: the front-end technologies used to create the user interface

Thymeleaf: a server-side Java template engine used to generate HTML pages

Bootstrap: a front-end framework for building responsive web applications
